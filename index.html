          I’m a passionate Software Developer and IT enthusiast currently in my final year at Embu University, set to graduate in September 2025. My journey in tech has been fueled by curiosity and a drive to build solutions that make a real impact.

I specialize in web and mobile development, working with technologies such as Python (Flask, Django), Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, Dart/Flutter, and SQL databases. Along the way, I’ve built projects ranging from hospital management systems to e-commerce platforms and AI-powered health prediction tools.

         I build modern and responsive web and mobile applications, ensuring clean design and smooth functionality. I also specialize in database management with MySQL, creating secure and optimized data solutions. With experience in AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity, I integrate smart and secure features into applications, and I develop custom systems such as hospital management and inventory tools to improve organizational efficiency.
